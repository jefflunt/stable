T002: simply gem name and classes
- rename the gem from `stable_spec` to `stable`
- change the name of the `lib/stable_spec` folder to `lib/stable`
- change the name of the `StableSpec::Record` class to `Stable::Spec`
- change the github remote in `.git/config` to point to a repository named `stable` (I will separately take care of renaming the repo on github)
